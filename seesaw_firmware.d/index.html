which has the schematic diagram for the Seesaw.

    <li>The schematic for the Seesaw Breakout is needed as a sanity
check, before connecting the 3.3v feed from the Adalogger, to the
(otherwise unpowered) Seesaw Breakout module.

    which has the needed <em>firmware</em>.

<li>SD card in its carrier; that into the host PC's SD card slot

<li>mount the SD card on the host PC such that df shows it is present (use Nautilus)

    <ul>
        <li><code>exec /usr/bin/nautilus --no-desktop "$@" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</code>
    </ul>

<li>unzip the firmware file

<li>take a checksum of the firmware .bin file (md5sum is good here)

<li>rename it to fw.bin (mine was seesaw.bin, from the .zip file)

<li>give it 30 seconds to sync, then eject the SD card (logically,
using the user interface, such as Nautilus -- not physically)

<li>df to check mount points (should be there before the eject was
    done, but not after)

<li>Once df shows the volume is no longer mounted, it is safe to
remove the SD card physically.  You can also use 'eject' at some
point (on the command line).  Nautilus ought to have taken care of
that, one would suppose.

<li>Wire them up!  Use the tutorial.  The tricky pins are the 3 volt
pins as you have to decide where the power comes from and what it
is used to supply power to.

<ul>

    <li>The Adalogger would be the source of the supply voltage,
        as it'll be the one connected via USB to the host PC.
        In the case of the Seesaw Breakout, this is perfectly
        obvious since it doesn't have an USB connector!

    <li>Adalogger supplies 3.3VDC on a pin near the corner where
        the USB connector is. RST, 3V3, AREF, GND are there (in
        that sequence, from the corner).  Use 3V3.

    <li>Dean Miller chose 3VO (not Vout) as the interconnect with
        <strong>Gemma M0</strong> power supply.  Schematic of
        Gemma M0 shows that
        it's the output of the voltage regulator on the 'client'
        board (Gemma M0 in the case of the tutorial) that is the
        connection point for power. <p> In other words, if there is a

        <!-- split here --!>

        current path *through* the onboard 3.3v regulator (from
        unregulated source, through the regulator, to the output)
        then you've connected things wrong.  The idea is to connect
        the Adalogger's regulator's output to the very same spot
        the local regulator's output is connected to (thus bypassing it).

    <li>Time-index: Fri Jan 12 19:50:09 UTC 2018

    <li>The proper connection to Seesaw Breakout is the 3.3V pin
        next to the GND pin. Avoid the +5V pin (the only other
        logical interconnect candidate for supplying power to
        Seesaw Breakout).

    <li>Take one last look at the pinout diagram for the Seesaw Breakout.

    <li>Time-index: Fri Jan 12 20:23:45 UTC 2018

</ul>

<li><strong>smoke test</strong> Eye protection on! This is the fun
    part -- to see if it's a short circuit or not.  I like to use a
    direct DC supply (no laptop or host PC at all, just 5V power via USB
    'charger' type of supply).  I put both an on/off switch, and an
    ammeter, inline.

<li>Select the right board in Arduino IDE: Feather M0 (that's also
    the Adalogger, which has an SPI peripheral in the form of an SD
    card reader.  Could just as easily be connected externally, so
    it's not a special target board -- it's a Feather M0).

<li>Prep a serial terminal for 9600 baud connection to the Adalogger.

<li>Find the example sketch (following Dean Miller's tutorial).

<li>Compile and upload to Adalogger!

<li>Time-index: Fri Jan 12 21:31:19 UTC 2018 -- working example is running.  setPWMFreq() is now testable.

<li><strong>servo</strong>: There are three wires.  Brown is GND.  Middle (orange) wire is the +5VDC rail, and the outside (yellow) wire is signal.

<li><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>: The pinout for the Pi is found in a diagram online.  The +5VDC rail is deep in the corner (two pins in the same long row, and no pins between +5V and the edge of the board in the corner).

 Next to the two +5V pins is a GND (there are several GND connections on this 40-pin bus). 

<li><em>future</em>
</ul>
